# NBA-PER-Calculator
Python program that will scrape specified years of player by year data from the basketball reference website. Calculating my arbitrary PER (player efficiency rating) and then storing it as a new variable for each player. Each years worth of data is saved in a separate SQL database. This was completed as my final project for CS181/DA210.
